## 📝 Notes for Next Session

1. **Skip Logic**: Current implementation allows one skip per turn, skipped clue moves to end of queue. User wants refinement (marked as complex).

2. **Shuffle Behavior**: User wants to understand current shuffling and potentially:
   - Shuffle remaining clues between player turns
   - Shuffle between each phase

3. **Game Over Summary**: Show all clues at game end with instance counts (useful since multiple players can submit same person).

4. **Rules Page**: Need dedicated page explaining:
   - Three phases
   - Skip mechanics
   - Clue submission rules
   - Scoring system

## 🎉 Key Achievements

1. ✨ **Clean Codebase**: Removed all legacy platform references
2. 🎮 **Enhanced UX**: Smart clue suggestions feature
3. 📱 **Production Ready**: Confirmed Railway deployment working
4. 📚 **Clear Documentation**: Single source of truth (Railway)
5. 🧹 **Simplified Model**: Phase-based instead of round-based
