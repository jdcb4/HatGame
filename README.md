## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier available)
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd word-guesser-multiplayer
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/word-guesser?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

3. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This starts both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 5173).

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. **Create a free account** at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. **Create a new cluster** (free M0 tier)
3. **Create a database** called `thehatgame_db`
4. **Create a database user** with read/write permissions
5. **Whitelist your IP** (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for development)
6. **Get your connection string** and add it to `.env`

## Deployment to Railway (Production)

**Railway is the recommended platform** for this Socket.IO multiplayer game.

## Game Rules

**The Hat Game** is played in three phases using the same set of clues (person names):

### Setup
1. **Join Game:** Players create or join using a Game ID
2. **Join Teams:** 2-4 teams, at least 2 players per team
3. **Submit Clues:** Each player submits 6 person names (real or fictional)

### Three Phases
1. **Phase 1: Describe** - Use as many words as you want to describe the person
2. **Phase 2: One Word** - Say exactly ONE WORD only to give a clue  
3. **Phase 3: Charades** - Act it out silently - no words or sounds!

### Gameplay
- Teams alternate turns with a timer (default: 45 seconds)
- Describer sees clues one at a time from the shared pool
- Correct guess = +1 point, clue is removed from pool
- Can skip 1 clue per turn (but must answer it before skipping again)
- Phase completes when all clues are guessed â†’ advance to next phase
- Game ends after Phase 3, highest score wins!
