## Why Railway Over Vercel?
- ‚úÖ **Persistent WebSocket connections** (Socket.IO works perfectly)
- ‚úÖ **Always-on server** (no cold starts)
- ‚úÖ **Simple deployment** (auto-detects your setup)
- ‚úÖ **Free $5/month credits** (enough for testing)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time multiplayer works flawlessly**

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables (3 minutes)

1. Once deployed, click on your project
2. Click the **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"New Variable"** and add these:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://TickyTestUser:kGg2Wm9B4W5yvGU1@jdtickytest.uybysp2.mongodb.net/word-guesser?retryWrites=true&w=majority
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3002
```

4. Click **"Add"** for each variable

**Note:** `CLIENT_URL` will be set after we get your Railway URL

1. In your project, click on the **deployment**
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Domains"** section
4. Click **"Generate Domain"**

## Step 6: Test Your Game! (5 minutes)

1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Create a game as Player 1
3. Open incognito/another browser
4. Join the game as Player 2
5. **Watch the player list update in real-time!** üéâ
6. Start the game and play

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Players see each other join immediately
- ‚úÖ Game state syncs in real-time
- ‚úÖ No disconnections
- ‚úÖ Smooth gameplay
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO works perfectly!

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway build logs (click "Deployments" ‚Üí latest deployment ‚Üí "View Logs")
2. Make sure all environment variables are set
3. Check MongoDB Atlas allows connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

### If app loads but doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `CLIENT_URL` matches your Railway domain exactly
3. Check Railway app logs for server errors

## Cost Estimate

**Free Tier:**
- $5 credit per month
- ~550 hours of runtime
- For testing with 4 people occasionally: **FREE**

**If you exceed free tier:**
- ~$5-10/month for a small app with light usage
- You'll get email warnings before being charged

## Updating Your App

After making changes locally:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```

Railway automatically redeploys on every push! üöÄ
