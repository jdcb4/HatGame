# Development Session Summary
**Date:** October 22, 2025

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Fixed Turn Rotation Bug üêõ
**Problem:** Teams were playing twice in a row, or getting skipped entirely.

**Root Cause:** Multiple clients sending `end-turn` action simultaneously (when timer expired) caused `handleEndTurn` to execute 3 times with stale data.

**Solution:** Added concurrency guard (`isEndingTurn` flag) to prevent duplicate processing.

**Also Fixed:** Navigation race condition in LobbyScreen where button and useEffect both tried to navigate.

**Files Changed:**
- `server/index.js` - Added `isEndingTurn` flag and guard
- `client/src/components/LobbyScreen.jsx` - Removed duplicate navigation

**Documentation:** See `BUG_ANALYSIS_TURN_ROTATION.md` for full technical analysis.

---

### 2. Implemented Hint Feature üí°
**What:** Describer gets 2 hints per turn to help describe difficult words.

**How It Works:**
- Hint button shows remaining count: "üí° Hint (2)"
- Clicking shows hint in blue box below category
- Hints automatically clear when word changes or turn ends
- Configurable via `gameSettings.hintsPerTurn` (ready for lobby settings)

**Files Changed:**
- `server/models/Game.js` - Added `hintsPerTurn` and `hintsRemaining` fields
- `server/index.js` - Added `handleUseHint` function and socket handler
- `client/src/components/GameScreen.jsx` - Added hint UI and state management

**Documentation:** See `HINT_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` for implementation details.

---

### 3. Restructured Word Data System üìù
**Old System:** 6 CSV files (actions, entertainment, food, hobbies, places, things)

**New System:** 1 CSV file with 3 categories (Who, Where, What) and hints

**CSV Structure:**
```csv
Word,Category,Hint
Albert Einstein,Who,Famous physicist who developed theory of relativity
Paris,Where,Capital of France
Pizza,What,Italian dish with cheese and toppings
```

**New Script:** `npm run convert-words` - Converts CSV to words.js

**Files Changed:**
- Deleted 6 old CSV files
- Created `server/data/csv/words.csv` (single file)
- Created `server/data/convertWords.js` (conversion script)
- Updated `package.json` - Added convert-words script
- Regenerated `server/data/words.js` with new structure

**Documentation:** See `WORD_SYSTEM_README.md` for usage guide.

---

### 4. Removed Debug Text üßπ
Removed "X words remaining" text from describer view (was showing backend caching info).

---

### 5. Clarified Deployment Strategy üöÄ
**Decision:** Keep using Railway for production (Vercel not suitable for Socket.IO).

**Reason:** Vercel's serverless architecture doesn't support persistent Socket.IO connections. Railway's persistent servers work perfectly.

**Files Updated:**
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added warning about Vercel, clarified Railway is production
- `README.md` - Updated hosting section and features list
- No code changes needed (Railway already working perfectly)

---

### 6. Updated Documentation üìö
- **Updated:** `TODO.txt` - Marked completed tasks, added "Round 4 of 3" issue
- **Updated:** `README.md` - Reflected new features and Railway deployment
- **Updated:** `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Clarified Railway is production choice
- **Created:** `BUG_ANALYSIS_TURN_ROTATION.md` - Technical analysis of bug fix
- **Created:** `HINT_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details
- **Created:** `WORD_SYSTEM_README.md` - User guide for word management
- **Created:** `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file!

## Remaining Tasks

### Active (from TODO.txt):
1. **Fix "Round 4 of 3" display** - Cosmetic issue after final turn
2. **Add Settings Panel** - Let host customize game settings in lobby
3. **Architecture Refactor** - Extract reusable multiplayer infrastructure (future)

---

## Testing Performed
‚úÖ Turn rotation works correctly (Team 0 ‚Üí Team 1 ‚Üí Team 0)
‚úÖ Hints display and auto-clear properly
‚úÖ Hint count decrements correctly
‚úÖ Word conversion script works
‚úÖ No linter errors

## Next Session Priorities
1. Fix "Round 4 of 3" cosmetic issue (quick fix)
2. Add game settings panel in lobby (medium task)
3. Continue adding words to CSV with hints

---

## Technical Notes
- Server running on Railway (production)
- MongoDB Atlas for database
- Socket.IO with word preloading (0ms delay)
- Optimistic client updates
- Concurrency guards prevent race conditions
- All documentation up to date
